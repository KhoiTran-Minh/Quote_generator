# Quote Generator

This is my school project for the course "Intro to python" at the University of Technology and Educations.
I create 2 programs that generate random quotes.The first use a simple random number generator and the second use a more complex one.
The Quote_generator_simple is complete and it's a simple program that generate random quotes.
The Quote_generator_DL is complete and it's a more complex program that generate random quotes.

The Quote_gener_DL is not complete because I just have train the DL model to test the use of it.The training task was so long so I decided to complete it later.

Finally Thanks to the owner of the datasets: AMIT MITTAL
